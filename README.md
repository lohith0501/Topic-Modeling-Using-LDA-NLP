# Topic-Modeling-Using-LDA-NLP
Topic modeling is one of the way to extract keywords in a document. This can be primarily implemented using 3 methods such as LDA (Latent Dirichilet Allocation), NMF , LSI. Here i am using LDA for analyzing a text document and extracting its keywords. Here i have used pyLDAVis library for visualization which i felt is the best for visualizing LDA models.
